# Practice Questions

## 1. Margin calls on short futures contracts

Suppose that you enter into a short futures contract to sell July silver for
\$17.20 per ounce. The size of the contract is 5,000 ounces. The initial margin
is \$4,000, and the maintenance margin is \$3,000. What change in the futures
price will lead to a margin call? What happens if you do not meet the margin
call?

---

### Given:

* Contract type: Short futures (i.e., you're agreeing to sell silver in the
  future)
* Futures price at entry: \$17.20 per ounce
* Contract size: 5,000 ounces
* Initial margin: \$4,000
* Maintenance margin: \$3,000

### What triggers a margin call?

A margin call occurs when your margin account balance drops below the
maintenance margin. You start with \$4,000, and you'll get a margin call when
your account balance falls below \$3,000 (maintenance margin)---that's a loss of
\$1,000.

### What futures price change leads to a \$1,000 loss?

Since this is a short futures contract, you profit when the price falls, and
lose when the price rises. We calculate the price change that results in a
\$1,000 loss:

$$
\text{Loss} = \text{Change in price} \times \text{Contract size}
$$

So

$$
1,000 = \Delta P \times 5,000
  \Rightarrow \Delta P = \frac{1,000}{5,000} = 0.20
$$

An \$0.20 increase in the futures price (from \$17.20 to \$17.40) will lead to a
margin call.

### What happens if you don't meet the margin call?

If you fail to meet the margin call (i.e., you don't deposit enough to restore
the margin to the initial level):

  * Your borker will close out (liquidate) your position.
  * This locks in your loss.
  * You may also incur penalties or fees depending on your borkerage agreement.

## 2. Long futures contracts

Suppose that in September 2021 a company takes a long position in a contract on
May 2022 crude oil futures. It closes out its position in March 2022. The
futures price (per barrel) is \$48.30 when it enters into the contract, \$50.50
when it closes out its position, and \$49.10 at the end of December 2021. One
contract is for the delivery of 1,000 barrels. What is the company's total
profit? When is it realized? How is it taxed if it is (a) a hedger and (b) a
speculator? Assume that the company has a December 31 year end.

---

### Given:

* Initial position (long): September 2021 at \$48.30
* Exit position: March 2022 at \$50.50
* Price at year-end (Dec 31, 2021): \$49.10
* Contract size: 1,000 barrels

### Calculate total profit

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Profit} &= (\text{Sell price} - \text{buy price})
  \times \text{contract size}\\
  &= (\$50.50 - \$48.30) \times 1,000\\
  &= \$2.20 \times 1,000\\
  &= \$2,200
\end{aligned}
$$

### When is the profit realized?

Futures are marked to market daily, but for accounting and tax purposes, it
depends on whether the company is a hedger or a speculator.

#### Hedger

##### Profit realization

Hedgers typically match the gain or loss on the futures with the loss or gain on
the underlying exposure.

##### Taxation

The gain/loss is realized in the same period as the underlying item being
hedged. If the hedge is of inventory or expected purchase/sale, the gain/loss is
often deferred and included in the cost basis of the transaction. No taxable
gain in 2021 if the underlying transaction is in 2022---taxed in 2022.

#### Speculator

##### Profit realization

Speculators realize gains/loss as they occur

##### Taxation

60/40 Rule (U.S. Tax Code Section 1256) applies: 60\% of the gain is taxed at
the long-term capital gains rate. 40\% is taxed at the short-term rate,
regardless of holding period. Year-end marking to market applies:

Profit recognized in 2021:

$$
(\$49.10 - \$48.30) \times 1,000 = \$800\\
$$

Remaining profit recognized in 2022:

$$
(\$50.50 - \$49.10) \times 1,000 = \$1,400
$$

### Summary

| Role | Realized profit | Tax timing | Tax notes |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Hedger | \$2,200 | Likely all in 2022 | Matched with hedged item |
| Speculator | \$800 (2021), \$1,400 (2022) | 60/40 capital gains split each year | Mark-to-market applies |

## 3. Stop order to sell

What does a stop order to sell at \$2 mean? When might it be used? What does a
limit order to sell at \$2 mean? When might it be used?

---

A stop order to sell at \$2 means that an order to sell will be created when
the price falls to \$2. This is used when you want to limit your losses if the
price begins to fall.

A limit order to sell at \$2 means that an order to sell will be created when
the price is \$2 or better. This is used when you want to sell the underlying
asset at the price or better.

---

## 4. Differences in exchange markets

What differences exist in the way prices are quoted in the foreign exchange
futures market, the foreign exchange spot market, and the foreign exchange
forward market?

---

### Foreign Exchange Spot Market

The spot market involves immediate (or near-immediate) delivery, typically
within 2 business days. The prices are quoted as currency pairs (e.g.,
`EURO/USD = 1.1100`. This means 1 euro buys 1.11 U.S. dollars.

The base currency (left) is being bought/sold for the quote currency (right).
Direct vs indirect quotes depend on the country. Bid/ask spreads are shown: e.g.
`1.1100 / 1.1102`.

### Foreign Exchange Forward Market

A contract to buy or sell a currency at a specified price on a future date
(beyond the spot date). Prices are usually quoted as a forward premium or
discount relative to the spot rate.

Spot EUR/USD = 1.1100
3-month forward points = +0.0020
Forward rate = 1.1120

Premium/discount is often quoted in "points", which are added to or subtracted
from the spot price. Large dealers often quote just the forward points, not the
full forward rate.

### Foreign Exchange Futures Market

Standardized contracts traded on an exchange (like CME) for buying/selling a
currency at a future date.

Price quotes are usually inverted compared to spot. EUR/USD = 1.1100, a futures
contract migh quote USD/EUR = 0.9009. Prices are quoted in terms of U.S. dollars
per unit of foreign currency, but the quote structure is determined by the
exchange's convention.

These are quoted with standardized tick sizes and expiration dates. Margin
requirements apply.

---

## 5. Options on futures contracts

The party with a short position in a futures contract sometimes has options as
to the precise asset that will be delivered, where delivery will take place,
when delivery will take place, and so on. Do these options increase or decrease
the futures price? Explain your reasoning.

---

These delivery options held by the short party in a futures contract
generally decrease the futures price.

When the short position (the seller) has flexibility in: which specific asset
to deliver, where to deliver it, and when to deliver it; they gain valuable
optionality---meaning they can choose the most favorable delivery conditions
at the time of contract settlement.

---

## 6. Purpose of margin accounts

Explain how margin accounts protect futures traders against the possiblity of
default.

---

Margin accounts are a critical risk management tool in futures traading. They
protect both traders and exchanges against default by ensuring that participants
have enough capital to cover potential losses as the market moves.

### What is a margin account?

A margin account is a security deposit that both buyers and sellers must
maintain with their broker or clearinghouse when entering a futures contract.
It's not a down payment--it's there to guarantee performance of the contract.

There are several components of the margin system:

a. Initial margin, or the amount required to open a position. Typically a
small percentage of the contract's full value.

b. maintenance margin, or the minimum balance the account must maintain. If
the margin falls below this level due to losses, a margin call is issued.

c. Variation margin (mark-to-market), futures contracts are marked to
market daily. Gains and losses are credited or debited daily to/from the
margin account. This daily settlement limits the accumulation of large
unpaid losses.

### How margin accounts prevent defaults

Margin accounts prevent default by:

a. Daily Loss Coverage: Since all positions are settled daily, losses are
realized and paid every day. This prevents large debts from building up,
which reduces the risk that a tarader can't pay.

b. Margin Calls: If losses push the account below the maintenance margin,
the trader must immediately deposit more funds. If they don't, the broker
can liguidate the position to prevent further losses.

c. Exchange Risk Control: The exchange (or clearinghouse) manages the
process and becomes the central counterparty to all trades. The margin
system ensures that the clearinghouse is always protected, regardless of
which side wins or loses.

---

## 7. Margin calls on futures contracts

A trader buys two July futures contracts on frozen orange juice concentrate.
Each contract is for the delivery of 15,000 pounds. The current futures price is
160 cents per pound, the initial margin is \$6,000 per contract, and the
maintenance margin is \$4,500 per contract. What price change would lead to a
margin call? Under what circumstances could \$2,000 be withdrawn from the margin
account?

---

### Given:

* Number of contracts: 2
* Contract size: 15,000 pounds each
* Futures price: 160 cents/pound
* Initial margin (per contract): \$6,000
* Maintenance margin (per contract): \$4,500
* Total initial margin deposited: $2 \times \$6,000 = \$12,000$
* Total maintenance margin: $2 \times \$4,500 = \$9,000$

A margin call happens when the value of your margin account falls below the
maintenance margin level. For two contracts that is \$9,000

So the maximum allowed loss before a margin call is:
$\$12,000 - \$9,000 = \$3,000$.

The price change would have to be:

$$
2 \times 15,000 = 30,000\ \text{pounds}\\
$$

Each 1 cent/pound drop in price results in:

$$
30,000 \times \$0.01 = \$300\ \text{loss}
$$

To lose \$3,000, the price must drop:

$$
\frac{\$3,000}{\$300} = 10\ \text{cents}
$$

So if the price drops from 160 cents to 150 cents, the margin account falls
below \$9,000 and a margin call is initiated.

To withdraw \$2,000, the account must have excess margin above the initial
margin requirement of \$12,000. A gain of \$2,000 would allow this.

$$
\frac{\$2,000}{\$300} = 6.67\ \text{cents (rounded)}
$$

---

## 8. Future arbitrage opportunities

Show that, if the futures price of a commodity is greater than the spot price
during the delivery period, then there is an arbitrage opportunity. Does an
arbitrage opportunity exist if the futures price is less than the spot price?
Explain your answer.

---

During the delivery period, you can deliver the actual commodity to fulfill a
futures contract. So if the futures price is higher than the spot price,
there's a profit opportunity:

### Arbitrage Strategy

1. Buy the commodity at the spot price (lower).
2. Deliver it against the futures contract (sell at the higher futures
   price).
3. Lock in risk-free profit: Profit = Futures Pirce - Spot Price.

This is possible because the contract is deliverable during this time, and
the arbitrageur can directly use the spot market to fulfill the futures
obligation.

### What if the future price is less than the spot price?

Let's try the reverse:

1. Sell the commodity in the spot market (high price).
2. Buy the commodity via the futures contract (low price).

The problem is you can't demand delivery of the commodity via the futures
contract. Only the short (seller) has the right to deliver. As the long as
you can't force delivery early or during the delivery window unless the
seller chooses to deliver. No arbitrage exists if futures < spot, because you
can't force delviery from the futures contract to obtain the commodity and
resell it.

---

## 9. Types of orders: Market-if-touched versus stop order

Explain the difference between a market-if-touched order and a stop order.

---

A market-if-touched (MIT) order and a stop order are both conditional orders
used to enter or exit positions, but they work in opposite directions and are
used in different market scenarios.

### Market-if-touched (MIT) order

These are used to enter or exit a position when the market moves in your
favor. They are triggerd when the market touches a more favorable price. They
become a market order once the trigger price is touched.

__EXAMPLE__: Suppose a stock is trading at \$50, and you want to buy if it
drops to \$45. You place a buy MIT at \$45. If the price touches \$45, your
order becomes a market buy order.

### Stop order

These are used to limit losses or protect gains when the market moves against
you. They are triggered when the market reaches a less favorable price. They
become a market order once the stop price is hit.

__EXAMPLE__: You own a stock at \$50, and want to sell if it drops to \$45 to
limit loss. You place a sell stop at \$45. If the price falls to \$45, your
order becomes a market sell order.

---

## 10. Types of orders: stop-limit order

Explain what a stop-limit order to sell at 20.30 with a limit of 20.10 means.

---

A stop-limit order is a combination of a stop order and a limit order. The
stop price (20.30) is the trigger point. Once the stock price falls to or
below \$20.30, the order becomes active. The limit price (20.10), once
triggered, the order becomes a limit order to sell at no less than \$20.10.

So once the stock falls to 20.30 the stop price trigger point begins selling
the stock. If the stock falls further to 20.10, then another trigger is
triggered and the selling stops.

---

## 11. Margin account: Mark-to-market for futures contracts

At the end of one day a clearing house member is long 100 contracts, and the
settlement price is \$50,000 per contract. The original margin is \$2,000 per
contract. On the following day the member becomes responsible for clearing an
additional 20 long contracts, entered into at a price of \$51,000 per contract.
The settlement price at the end of this day is \$50,200. How much does the
member have to add to its margin account with the exchange clearing house?

---

This is a margin and mark-to-market calculation for futures contracts.

### Key Data

#### Day 1 close:

* Long: 100 contracts
* Settlement price: \$50,000
* Original margin: \$2,000/contract

#### Day 2 activity:

* Adds 20 more long contracts at \$51,000
* New total: 120 contracts
* Day 2 settlement price: \$50,200

### Step 1: Day 1 margin requirement

Initial margin required for the 100 contracts:

$$
100 \times 2,000 = \$200,000
$$

This already is in the margin account for Day 1.

### Step 2: New contracts on day 2

Member adds 20 new contracts at \$51,000

Initial margin for those 20:

$$
20 \times 2,000 = \$40,000
$$

So \$40,000 must be added ot cover the initial margin for the new 20 contracts.

### Step 3: Mark-to-market adjustment on day 2

We now compute the daily gain or loss based on the change in the sttlement
price.

#### For the 100 original contracts

* Bought effectively at \$50,000 (prior day's settlement)
* New settlement = \$50,200 for a gain of \$200 per contract

$$
100 \times 200 = +\$20,000
$$

#### For the 20 new contracts

* Bought at \$51,000
* New settlement = \$50,200 for a loss of \$800 per contract

#### Net mark-to-market

$$
+20,000 - 16,000 = +\$4,000
$$

So instead of needing to add for losses, the member actually gains \$4,000,
which is credited to their margin account.

### Final answer

* Initial margin required for 20 new contracts: \$40,000
* Mark-to-market gain: \$4,000
* Net amount to be added to the margin account:

$$
40,000 - 4,000 = \$36,000
$$

## 12. OTC market regulations

Explain why collateral requirements increased in the OTC market as a result of
regulations introduced since the 2008 financial crisis.

---

Before the financial crisis, the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market was
lightly regulated and dominated by large financial institutions dealing
bilaterally. This meant that there was limited transparency in those
transactions.

The changes made were that there was now a mandaotory clearing house needed,
This standardized margin requirements. Collateral must be highly liquid and of
good quality.

---

## 13. Differences between forward and futures pricing

The forward price of the Swiss franc for delivery in 45 days is quoted as
1.1000. The futures price for a contract that will be delivered in 45 days is
0.9000. Explain these two quotes. Which is more favorable for a trader wanting
to sell Swiss francs?

---

### Given:

* Forward price for CHF in 45 days: 1.1000
* Futures price for CHF with same delivery date: 0.9000

There is a difference of .2000 between the forward price and the futures price.

### Why the discrepancy?

Even though both contracts reference the same asset and delivery date, the
contracts differ in important ways:

1. Forward contracts are OTC contracts between two parties. There is no daily
   settlement, margin requirements and are priced using interest rate
   differentials.

2. Futures contracts are standardized and traded on exchanges. They are
   marked-to-market daily and they require initial and maintenance margins.

The difference is due to what's called the "futures-forwards divergence", which
is mostly influenced by:

#### Interest rate volatility (Convexity bias):

Futures are settled daily (mark-to-market), while forwards are settled at
maturity. If interest rates and asset prices are correlated, this can create
pricing differences. In this case, if USD interest rates are volatile or
falling, the futures price migh underestimate the forward price.

### Supply & Demand pressures:

Market forces can push futures prices away from theoretical forward values,
especially if traders are using on emore than the other for hedgining or
speculation.

### Which is better for a trader wanting to sell CHF?

Selling CHF at 1.1000 (forward) gives you more USD per franc than selling at
0.9000 (Futures). So the forward contract is more favorable.

### Final answer

The forward price is higher because it reflects spot rates plus the interest
rate differential between USD and CHF, without the impact of daily settlement.
The futures price is lower likely due to interest rate volatility and
mark-to-market effects. For a trader wanting to sell Swiss francs, the forward
contract at 1.1000 is more favorable, as it provides more USD per franc.

---

## 14. Mechanics of selling future contracts

Suppose you call your broker and issue instructions to sell one July hogs
contract. Describe what happens.

---

### 1. You place the order with your broker

You instruct your broker to sell 1 July Lean Hogs futures contract. This means
you are taking a short position and agreeing to deliver hogs (or settle the
contract) in July at the current futures price. You don't need to own
hogs---this can be a speculative or hedging position, and most contracts are
cash-settled or closed before delivery.

### 2. Broker sends the order to the exchange

Your broker routes your order to the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) where
Lean Hogs futures are traded. The system looks for a matching buy order for July
hogs at the price you're willing to accept. Once matched, your short position is
established.

### 3. Initial margin is posted

To open the position, you must post an initial margin. This is a good faith
deposit, not the full contract value. For hogs, it might be in the range of
\$1,200-\$2,500, but it varies by volatility and exchange rules. The notional
value of the contract is much larger.

### 4. Mark-to-market begins

At the end of each trading day: your position is marked ot market--adjusted to
reflect the change in the contract's price. If the price goes down (favorable to
your short), you receive a gain. If the price goes up, you must post a variation
margin to cover the loss.

### 5. Closing the position or holding to expiration

You can: Offset your position later by buying one July hogs contract (closing
your short). Or, if you do nothing, and hold it until the contract expires, the
exchange will: Either require physical delivery (rare---only a few traders do
this), or facilitate cash settlement or position offset depending on the
contract rules. Most traders close out the position before the first notice day
to avoid delivery.

---

## 15. Efficacy of the futures market

"Speculation in futures markets is pure gambling. It is not in the public
interest to allow speculators to trade on a futures exchange." Discuss this
viewpoint.

---

Speculation is not gambling, which is a game of change. Speculation in the
futures markets involves taking informed risk-taking based on market analysis,
data, and trends. Speculators offer several benefits for futures exchanges:

1. They provide liquidity by adding the number of buyers and sellers in the
   market. This means that you get better price discovery and tighter bid-ask
   spreads for everyone.

2. Speculators also have the benefit of taking the other side of hedgers who
   want to reduce their risk.

3. Speculators help to provide a more efficient market.

---

## 16. Importance of asset quality

What do you think would happen if an exchange started trading a contract in
which the quality of the underlying asset was incompletely specified?

---

If the quality of the underlying asset is incompletely specified then the market
would not effectively work.

### 1. Futures contracts rely on standardization

One of the defining features of a futures contract is that it's highly
standardized: quantity, qualtiy, delivery time, location---all clearly defined.
This ensures that everyone knows exactly what they're buying or selling.

### 2. Uncertainty = basis risk and legal risk

Incomplete quality specs increase basis risk---the risk that the futures price
and the actual spot price fo what you deliver won't align. Buyers may receive
lower-quality goods than expected. Disputes over delivery and legal challenges
could become common.

### 3. Hedgers would avoid the contract

Companies that use futures to hedge their real-world price risk want precision.
If they don't know what they'll receive/deliver, the contract is useless as a
hedge. This causes low adoption, which kills liquidity.

### 4. Speculators may take advantage---or stay away

Some speculators may try to exploit the vagueness, but most will avoid markets
with ambiguous terms. Pricing becomes erratic or disconntected from
fundamentals. Volatility spikes, and regulators might step in.

### Real-world parallel: The early days of oil futures

When oil futures were introduced, the success of the contract depended on
clearly defining grade: "light sweet crude oil" at Cushing, Oklahoma. If the
spec was vague ("some kind of oil, maybe sweet, maybe heavy"), no one would have
used it.

### Final answer

If an exchange started trading a contract with incompletely specified quality:

* Trust would drop
* Hedgers would stay away
* Legal and delivery disputes would rise
* Market liquidity would collapse
* The contract would likely fail or be abandoned

Standardization and clarity are non-negotiable for successful futures trading.

---

## 17. Open interest in futures contracts

"When a futures contract is traded on the floor of the exchange, it may be the
the case that the open interest increases by one, stays the same, or decreases
by one." Explain this statement.

---

Open interest is the total number of outstanding futures contracts that are
active and not yet closed (i.e., not offset, expired, or delivered).

Every contract involves two parties: One long (buyer), and one short (seller).

So open interest tracks the number of active positions, not the total trades.

### How does a single trade affect open interest?

Let's say one futures contract is traded on the exchange floor. There are 3
possible scenarios, depending on whether the buyer or seller is opening or
closing a position.

#### Open interest increases by 1:

Both the buyer and seller are entering new positions. For example, trader A
opens a long position (new buyer) and trader B opens a short position (new
seller). A brand new contract is created and open interest increases by 1.

#### Open interest stays the same:

One trader is opening a new position and the other is closing an existing
position. For example, trader C opens a new long and trader D closes their
existing short. The number of total outstanding contracts doesn't change, just
shifts between traders. Open interest stays the same.

#### Open interest decreases by 1

Both the buyer and seller are closing exisitng positions. For example, trader E
closes their long and trader F closes their short. One full contract is removed
from the system. Open interest decreases by 1.

### Final thought

So, when a futures contract is traded on the floor: The change in open interest
depends on whether traders are opening or closing positions---not just whether a
trade occurred. That's what makes this metric so useful for analyzing market
participation and sentiment.

---

## 18. Futures contracts

Suppose that, on October 24, 2022, a company sells one April 2023 live cattle
futures contract. It closes out its position on January 21, 2023. The futures
price (per pound) is 121.20 cents when it enters into the contract, 118.30 cents
when it closes out its position, and 118.80 cents at the end of December 2022.
One contract is for the delivery of 40,000 pounds of cattle. What is the total
profit? How is it taxed if the company is (a) a hedger and (b) a speculator?
Assume that the company has a December 31 year end.

---

### Given:

* Short 1 contract: 40,000 pounds
* Futures price: 121.20 cents / pound
* Closing price: 118.30 cents / pound
* December 2022 price: 118.80 cents / pound

### Total profit

| Oct. 24, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2022 | Jan. 21, 2023 |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Open short position | Year End | Close short position |
| \$1.212 | \$1.188 | \$1.183 |

$$
\begin{aligned}
40,000 \times (1.212 - 1.188) = \$960\\
40,000 \times (1.188 - 1.183) = \$200
\end{aligned}
$$

### Hedging

For hedging all profit is realized in 2023: \$1,160. The hedging gains/losses
are taxed as normal business income. The gain or loss is matched with the
underlying transaction. The \$1,160 gain would be reported as ordinary income.

### Speculator

For speculators some of the profit is realized in 2022: \$960. The rest is
realized in 2023: \$200. Here the 60/40 rule will apply. 60\% of the
gains/losses will be taxed as long-term capital gain/loss and 40\% will be taxed
as short-term capital gain/loss.

| Year | Gain | 60\% LTCG | 40\% STCG |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 2022 | \$960 | \$576 | \$384 |
| 2023 | \$200 | \$120 | \$80 |

## 19. Pros and Cons of hedging futures markets

A cattle farmer expects to have 120,000 pounds of  live cattle to sell in 3
months. The live cattle futures contract traded by the CME Group is for the
delivery of 40,000 pounds of cattle. How can the farmer use the contract for
hedging? From the farmer's viewpoint, what are the pros and cons of hedging?

---

The farmer can buy 3 futures contracts for delivery in 3 months for 40,000
pounds of cattle to lock in the price and protect agains a falling market. The
pros for this is that the farmer has clarity about the price he will be paying
in three months.

### Pros

* Price certainty
* Reduce risk
* Helps with planning

### Cons

* Missed upside
* margin requirements
* Imperfect hedge
* Complexity

## 20. Hedging futures markets

It is July 2021. A mining company has just discovered a small deposit of gold.
It will take 6 months to construct the mine. The gold will then be extracted on
a more or less continuous basis for 1 year. Futures contracts on gold are
available with delivery months every 2 months from August 2021 to December 2022.
Each contract is for the delivery of 100 ounces. Discuss how the mining company
might use futures markets for hedging.

### Given

* Production of gold will begin in January 2022 and end December 2022.
* Delivery months for 2022: February, April, June, August, October, December.

### Hedge strategy

* Short futures contracts for February, April, June, August, October, and
  December.

* Depending on what the company expects the production to be they can by the
  corresponding contracts for the size (100 ounces). For example, if the company
  expects to produce 1,200 ounces total over 2022 at a rate of 100 ounces/month.
  Then the company can sell 1 contract per month.

### Final thoughts

This strategy will help the mining company lock in the price of gold for the
entire lifetime of the mine. However, they will not be able to benefit if the
market becomes favorable for them.

## 21. Central Counterparties

Explain how CCPs work. What are the advantages to the financial system of
requiring CCPs to be used for all standardized derivatives transactions between
financial institutions?

---

### What is a CCP (Central Counterparty)?

A central counterpary (CCP) is a middleman between buyers and sellers in a
financial market---most commonly in derivatives, like futures, options, and
swaps.

When two financial institutions enter into a derivatives contract, the CCP steps
in and becomes the counterparty to both sides. This means that the parties deal
with the CCP instead of each other directly.

### How CCPs work

#### Step 1: Trade execution

Two parties agree to a standardized derivative contract (e.g., interest rate
swap, futures contract).

#### Step 2: Clearing through CCP

The trade is submitted to a CCP for clearing. The CCP becomes the buyer to every
seller and the seller to every buyer.

#### Step 3: Initial margin posted

Both parties post initial margin to protect agains potential future losses.

#### Step 4: Daily mark-to-market

The CCP marks the position to market daily, and variation margin (daily
gains/losses) is exchanged.

#### Step 5: Default management

If a party defaults, the CCP uses the defaulting member's margin, and possibly a
default fund, to cover losses.

### Advantage of using CCPs for standardized derivatives

#### Reduces counterparty risk

Without a CCP, if one party defaults, the other party suffers. With a CCP, the
centralized risk management and margining system lowers the chance of losses
cascading through the system.

#### Transparency

CCPs require trade reporting and provide public data on open positions, margin,
etc. This helps regulators and participants monitor systemic risk.

#### Standardized risk management

CCPs enforce consistent margin requirements, default procedurs, and stress
testing. No relying on bilateral credit agreements that vary by counterparty.

#### Multilateral netting

CCPs net positions across multiple participants, reducing the gross notional
exposure in the market. For example, if a bank has offsetting trades with many
parties, CCPs net them down, reducing the capital required.

#### Crisis containment

During times of market stress, CCPs provide a cushion of stability with
pre-funded resources and a clear default waterfall.

## 22. Futures versus Forward contract analysis

Trader A enters into futures contracts to buy 1 million euros for 1.1 million
dollars in three months. Trader B enters in a forward contract to do the same
thing. The exchange rate (dollars per euro) declines sharply during the first
two months and then increases for the third month to close at 1.1300. Ignoring
daily settlement, what is the total profit of each trader? When the impact of
daily settlement is taken into account, which trader has done better?

---

### Ignoring daily settlement

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{profit} &= (1.1300 - 1.1000) \times 1,000,000\\
  &= \$30,000
\end{aligned}
$$

Both traders profit the same.

### Daily settlement

Futures are marked-to-market daily, while forwards are not. This makes a
difference because of the timing of cash flows and the time value of money.

#### First 2 months (down):

The exchange rate declines, so futures price also drops below 1.10. Trader A
(long futures) incurs daily losses as the euro depreciates. These losses require
cash outflows (variation margin calls).

#### Third month (up):

The euro rebounds and ends at 1.1300. Trader A earns back the losses and gains
more, but only at the end.

#### Forward contracts (Trader B):

No margin calls or cash flows until maturity. All of the gain is realized at
once, at the end of 3 months.

### Who did better?

Total profit is the same \$30,000. However, when considering time value of cash
flows, trader A's early losses and later gains make their profit less valuable
in present value terms. Trader B doesn't need to post margin and gets the full
profit at once.

Therefore, trader B (forward contract) does slightly better overall when
factoring in time value of money and opportunity cost of early margin calls.

### Final thought

Even though futures and forwards may look similar, daily settlement introduces
cash flow timing differences that can affect overall profitability---especially
in volatile markets.

## 23. Open interest

Explain what is meant by open interest. Why does the open interest usually
decline during the month preceding the delivery month? On a particular day,
there were 2,000 trades in a particular futures contract. This means that there
were 2,000 buyers (going long) and 2,000 sellers (going short). Of the 2,000
buyers, 1,400 were closing out positions and 600 were entering into new
positions. Of the 2,000 sellers, 1,200 were closing out positions and 800 were
entering into new positions. What is the impact of the day's trading on open
interest?

---

### What is open interest

Open interest refers to the total number of outstanding futures contracts that
have not been closed out or delivered. Every futures contract has two sides: a
buyer (long) and a seller (short). When a new position is opened, open interest
increases. When a position is closed, open interest decreases. Think of open
interest as a count of active contracts---it grows when new contracts are
created and shrinks when contracts are settled or offset.

### Why does open interest usually decline before delivery month?

As the delivery month approaches, many traders close out positions rather than
make or take delivery of the underlying assets. This is because speculators
don't want to deal with physical delivery, and hedgers may roll their positions
into a later month. Also, liquidity tends to shift to the next nearby contract.

### Let's analyze the trading day

* 2,000 total trades: 2,000 long postions and 2,000 short positions
* 1,400 of the 2,000 buyers were closing exisitng positions
* 600 buyers were opening new long positions
* 1,200 of the 2,000 sellers were closing existing positions
* 800 sellers were opening new short positions

| Buyer action | Seller Action | Effect on open interest | # of trades |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| New | New | +1 | min(600, 800) = 600 |
| Close | Close | -1 | min(1,400, 1,200) = 1,200 |
| New | Close | \ 0 | 600 - 600 = 0 |
| Close | New | \ 0 | 1,200 - 1,200 = 0 |

The key is that only trades where both parties open or both close affect open
interest.

### Final answer

$$
\text{Change} = + 600 - 1,200 = - 600
$$

Open interests are the number of active contracts. Here open interest decreased
by 600 contracts due to more closing trades than new ones.

## 24.  Sort futures margin requirements

A company enters into a short futures contract to sell 5,000 bushels of wheat
for 750 cents per bushel. The initial margin is \$3,000 and the maintenance
margin is \$2,000. What price change would lead to a margin call? Under what
circumstances could \$1,500 be withdrawn from the margin account?

---

### Given:

* contract size: 5,000
* Futures price: 750 cents / bushel
* Initial margin: \$3,000
* Maintenance margin: \$2,000

### Calculate the incremental gain 


$$
0.01 \times 5,000 = \$50
$$

A 1 cent move in the futures price, will move the margin account \$50.

### Price change for a margin call

To lose \$1,000, the price must increase:

$$
\frac{\text{initial margin} - \text{maintenance margin}}{50} = .2
$$

If the price were to rise 20 cents to 770, a margin call would be triggered.

### Withdrawal of \$1,500 from margin account

To gain \$1,500 in the margin account, the price must decrease:

$$
\frac{1,500}{50} = .3
$$

If the price were to decrease 30 cents to 720, \$1,500 could be withdrawn from
the margin account.

## 25. Futures contracts arbitrage

Suppose that there are no storage costs for crude oil and the interest rate for
borrowing or lending is 4\% per annum. How could you make money if the June and
December futures contracts from a particular year trade at \$50 and \$56,
respectively?

---

### Given:

* No storage costs
* Interest rate: .04
* June futures: \$50
* December futures: \$56
* Time between June and December: 6 months or 0.5 years

### Step 1: What should the December price be

Using the cost-of-carry formula for a non-storable (or no-storage-cost)
commodity:

$$
F_{\text{Dec}} = F_{\text{June}} \times e^{r T}
$$

Where:

* $F_{\text{June}} = 50
* $r = 0.04$
* $T = 0.5$

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{\text{Dec}} &= 50 \times e^{0.04 \times 0.5}\\
  &= 50 \times e^{0.02}\\
  &\approx 50 \times 1.0202\\
  &\approx 51.01
\end{aligned}
$$

The fair December futures price is about \$51.01. But it's trading at \$56,
which is too high.

### Step 2: Create an arbitrage strategy

1. Go long the June futures at \$50
2. Short the December futures at \$56
3. When June arrives store the oif for six months at \$0 cost and deliver the
   oil into your short December futures contract at \$56.

#### Profit

Financing cost

$$
\begin{aligned}
50 \times (e^{.02} - 1) \approx 50 \times 0.0202 = 1.01
\end{aligned}
$$

Net profit

$$
\begin{aligned}
56 - 50 - 1.01 = \$4.99\ \text{per barrel}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Summary

The December futures price is too high relative to June. To exploit this you
long June futures and short December futures. This involves storing the asset
for six months, but you lock in a risk-free profit.

## 26. Long forward + long put

What position is equivalent to a long forward contract to buy an asset at $K$ on
a certain date and a put option to sell it for $K$ on that date.

---

### Given:

1. A long forward contract to buy the asset at price $K$ on date $T$.
2. A long put option to sell the asset at price $K$ on the same date $T$.

---

### Step 1: Payoffs at Maturity $T$

Let the spot price of the asset at maturity be $S_T$

#### Long forward contract (buy at $K$):

$$
\text{Payoff} = S_T - K
$$

#### Long put option (sell at $K$):

$$
\text{Payoff} = \text{max}(K - S_T, 0)
$$


### Step 2: Add them together

$$
\text{Total payoff} = (S_T - K) + \text{max}(K - S_T, 0)
$$

Now consider two cases:

#### Case 1: $S_T \ge K$

* $\text{max}(K - S_T, 0) = 0$
* $\text{Total payoff} = S_T - K$

#### Case 2: $S_T < K$

* $\text{max}(K - S_T, 0) = K - S_T$
* $\text{Total payoff} = S_T - K + K - S_T = 0$

### Analysis

A long forward contract to buy at $K$ plus a long put option with strike $K$ is
equivalent to a long European call option with strike $K$ and maturity $T$.

This is a well-known put-call parity identity:

$$
\text{Call} = \text{forward} + \text{put}
$$

A visualization:

```{r, problem 26}
# Define the strike price
K <- 100

# Define a range of possible spot prices at maturity
S_T <- seq(50, 150, by = 1)

# Payoffs
forward_payoff <- S_T - K
put_payoff <- pmax(K - S_T, 0)
combined_payoff <- forward_payoff + put_payoff
call_payoff <- pmax(S_T - K, 0)

# Plotting
plot(S_T, combined_payoff, type = "l", col = "blue", lwd = 2,
     ylim = c(-50, 50), xlab = "Spot Price at Maturity (S_T)",
     ylab = "Payoff", main = "Long Forward + Long Put vs Long Call")

lines(S_T, forward_payoff, col = "red", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
lines(S_T, put_payoff, col = "green", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
lines(S_T, call_payoff, col = "purple", lwd = 2, lty = 3)

legend("topleft", legend = c("Long Forward + Long Put", "Long Forward", "Long Put", "Long Call"),
       col = c("blue", "red", "green", "purple"), lty = c(1, 2, 2, 3), lwd = 2)
```

## 27. Credit risk exposure

A bank's derivatives transactions with a counterparty are worth +\$10 million
to the bank and are cleared bilaterally. The counterparty has posted \$10
million of cash collateral. What credit exposure does the bank have?

---

### Given:

* The value of derivatives transactions to the bank is +\$10 million. This means
  the counterparty owes the bank \$10 million if all trades were settled today.

* Collateral posted by the counterparty: \$10 million in cash

* The trades are bilaterally cleared, not through a central counterparty (CCP)

### What is credit exposure?

Credit exposure is the amount the bank stands to lose if the counterparty
defaults, _net of any collateral_ held.

Since the counterparty posed \$10 million collateral for the \$10 million
derivative, the credit exposure is zero.

Since the collateral is cash there is no other risks. However, if the collateral
were something other than cash, or if the cash was not available to the bank
immediately in case of default, then there may be operational risk or maket
risk. These risks include time to liquidate the collateral or if market changes
affect the value of the collateral.
